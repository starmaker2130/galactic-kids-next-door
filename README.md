The **_Galactic Kids Next Door_** is a movement dedicated to:
(1) ending gun violence, especially towards children in North America, and
(2) fostering future communities of technologists and creatives through immersive programming.

Produced by [@oldrowmaryland](https://instagram.com/oldrowmaryland) for the House of Venus this platform connects online creators nd startups to DARIA, the swarm AI maintained by the House of Venus to guard schools and places of worship.

Members can use apps to create singular products or experiences by purchasing tokens and using them to pay for apps that require them.

Those who want to create can subscribe for developer access as a Creator or Enterprise and receive an unlimited amount of tokens along with programmatic and prompt-based access to DARIA.

Lyoko is the development environment/interface for DARIA. It manages multimodal queries from Members and processes them appropriately using a variety of modules including Falcon-40B for reasoning, HOVision for computer vision, etc.
